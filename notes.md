### Security
Principals can request to whitelist a teacher's laptop/IP address
Or have the teachers install a VPN client to access the school's network

### Transitioning
In end of year report, indicate if student will advance or repeat 
should_repeat (default=False)

#### 0. Ensure the next academic year is set up

#### 1. Unassign all teachers (automatically unassigns classes)

#### 2. Graduate students sequentially
Create Transition section that only appears in Summer vacation between years
When transitioning from year to year
- unassign all teachers from classes
- class advance sequence:
    - graduate std 5 where should_repeat=False

Transition list view
- list of students, report summary, checked as Advance if should_repeat is False
- Confirm button to advance students to next class
- start from std 5, all unenrolled from class, all set to is_active=False
- Redirect to list view, std 5 complete, std 4 ready to advance

#### 3. Register new inf 1 students

#### 4. Assign teachers to classes
